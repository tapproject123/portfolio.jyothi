    <h1>Project1</h1>
    <pre>Title : Sleep alert detection system
Duration : 6 months
Project Description : Driver sleep detection is a car safety technology which help to prevent accidents when 
                      the driver gets drowsy.Various studies have suggested that around 20% of road accidents 
                      are fatigue related.In recent years, driver drowsiness has been one of the major causes 
                      of road accidents and can lead to severe physical injuries, deaths and significant economic 
                      losses. Statistics indicate the need of a reliable driver drowsiness detection system which 
                      could alert the driver before a mishap happens.

    <h1>Project2</h1>
    <pre>Title : Heart disease prediction system
Duration : 6 months
Project Description : Nowadays Heart disease is considered as one of the major causes in today's world. It cannot
                      be easily predicted by the medical doctors as it is a difficult task that demands expertise 
                      and higher knowledge for prediction.There is a lot of data available within the healthcare 
                      systems over the internet. However, there is a lack of effective analysis tools to discover
                      hidden relationships and patterns in data.The Healthcare trade usually clinical diagnosis is 
                      ended typically by doctor's knowledge and practice. Computer Aided Decision Support System 
                      plays a major task in medical field.By using various classification techniques we will be 
                      predicting the heart disease with more accuracy.
